# The Last Holocron.io

If you are reading this, then what we feared has come to pass the J#di Order and by extension the The G****** Republic have fallen. The J#di high council enacted the last holocron protocol. This protocol aims to preserve the living knowledge of the orders experinces. Its aim is not to contain the enire knowledge of the J#di archives. But to allow a living growing history of the order to inform those that come next.

## THE CODE

- There is no emotion, there is peace.
- There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.
- There is no passion, there is serenity.
- There is no chaos, there is harmony.
- There is no death, there is the Force
